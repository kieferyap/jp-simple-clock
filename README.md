## Other stuff
- Why I did this: I was looking for a clock face that had all the features mentioned above, but I couldn't find any. There was one that was very close, but it doesn't display seconds and had no Japanese year.
- Why did I include Japanese year: I know the year is 2023, but I keep on forgetting the Japanese equivalent whenever I need to fill out forms, so...
- I know Taiwan has a 民国 year system, so if you want to clone this and make one, please feel free.
- Miscellaneous: This is literally my very first clock face. I did this to scratch my own itch, but perhaps it can scratch yours too.
- I did a memory test because there was one clock face that would black out after a while. You can see the results of the test [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kieferyap/jp-simple-clock/master/resources/memory-test.txt). The amount of memory consumed would go up for a few seconds, but would periodically reset.
