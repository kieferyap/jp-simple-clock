## Other info
- **Why I did this**: I was looking for a clock face that had all the features mentioned above, but I couldn't find any. There was one that was very close, but it doesn't display seconds and had no Japanese year.
- **Why I included Japanese year**: I know the year is 2023, but I keep on forgetting the Japanese equivalent whenever I need to fill out forms, so...
- **Memory Test**: I did a memory test because there was one clock face that would black out after a while. You can see the results of the test [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kieferyap/jp-simple-clock/master/resources/memory-test.txt). The amount of memory consumed would go up for a few seconds, but would periodically reset.
- **Cloning and republishing for free**: I know Taiwan has a 民國 year system, and a different system for dates, so if you want to clone this and publish one *for free*, please feel free. It would be nice if you could credit me by linking this repository though. 
- **Other comments**: This is literally my very first clock face. I did this to scratch my own itch, but perhaps it can scratch yours too.
